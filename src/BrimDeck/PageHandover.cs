// takes the page's elements before a rebuild; Release then lets them leave on a layer above the page (LeavingContent, laid out with
// the margin the page had) while the rebuilt content arrives, or drops them at once when the rebuild changed nothing that shows.
// A rebuild during a hand-over that is still under way keeps that hand-over going and drops only its own old elements, so a
// panel dragged across a size step does not cut its hand-over short 25 times a second. The page switch hands over a picture
// of the page it leaves (Capture, Send): the pages keep their own elements, and the monitor page keeps its view across switches.
// Each hand-over leaves on its own layer (a batch in the leaving layer), so a switch to another page while the last one is
// still leaving lets that one finish leaving instead of cutting it off (motion-review F17); the page that was still arriving
// leaves from where it was.
